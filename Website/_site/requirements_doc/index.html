<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This document is intended to guide the development of The Distraction Shield. It contains all of the features that are or will be implemented, their importance to the project, and why they are useful.</p>

<h2 id="general-information">General Information</h2>

<p>The Distraction Shield is a browser extension designed to take advantage of our human nature. It is a very common scenario to find ourselves browsing sites such as Facebook or Reddit while we are supposed to be working. The Distraction Shield can help you to do something useful and enriching; a distraction ‘Aikido’ (NOTE:  Aikido is a modern Japanese martial art that focuses on redirecting the momentum of an opponent’s attack.).</p>

<p>The main functionality of The Distraction Shield extension is to detect when the user enters a website that they consider a distraction. It then presents a language learning exercise instead. Once the user has completed the exercise, they will be free to continue onto the original site. The user can choose for which sites the redirection should happen, by adding domain names to a blacklist. With the success of language platforms like <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>, this simple exercise-based way of learning languages is merged into another popular area: distraction blocking apps such as <a href="https://getcoldturkey.com/">ColdTurkey</a>.</p>

<h2 id="target-users">Target Users</h2>

<p>This project is aimed at a large variety of users. These users can be of nearly all ages and backgrounds There are two main traits that these people have in common though: <strong>they are people that get easily distracted</strong> and <strong>people that would like to learn a new language.</strong> Everyone gets distracted or falls prey to procrastination every now and then. Furthermore there are lots of people that have the desire to learn new languages. One group of people one might think of are foreign students, or in general people living abroad. They most likely use computers on a daily basis and might want to pick up the local language. This extension fits the needs of these people perfectly.</p>

<h2 id="major-features">Major Features</h2>

<p>The main features of the extension are presented in this section. Distinction is made between critical, important, useful and excluded features.</p>

<h3 id="critical"><strong>Critical</strong></h3>

<h4 id="general-requirements">General Requirements:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The user can choose to restrict him/herself of visiting a website by adding a domain or specific url to their ‘blacklist’ or ‘BlockedSiteList’. This ‘blacklist’ contains all the sites for which, when the user attempts to enter them, the user is intercepted and instead redirected to a language learning exercise.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="system-requirements">System Requirements</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The extension is developed for Chrome.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="important"><strong>Important</strong></h3>

<h4 id="general-requirements-1">General Requirements:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>After installing the extension, the user will be presented with a tour of the extension’s pages: tooltip, options and statistics. How to use these pages and the functionality in general.</li>
</ul>

            <ul>
              <li>The user is always intercepted (NOTE:  When attempting to navigate to a blacklisted page and the interception is turned on.). When intercepted, the user has to complete the exercise to be able to go to the website they originally intended to visit.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>

            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>…there is a button that opens the options page, unless that page is open already, then it switches to that tab.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a minimal website that presents the extension</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The site should be developed using the GitHub pages</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="system-requirements-1">System Requirements:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Integrate extension with a third party that provides a platform where the user can make better users can make better use of their time.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Zeeguu platform provides language learning exercises for the users</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The extension should be able to extend to other similar platforms with different learning topics ( ex: programming, hobby, etc)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="useful"><strong>Useful</strong></h3>

<h4 id="interface-requirements-1">Interface Requirements:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Notifications about user’s behaviour.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The application should track the user behaviour :</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>How many times the user skips the exercise when in lazy mode</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Which mode is most used</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>After how much time the user deactivates the extension</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The users should be notified when they skip too many exercises (NOTE:  Became out of scope before final Iteration of this development team).</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="system-requirements-2">System Requirements:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The extension is ported to work on Firefox.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="excluded-features"><strong>Excluded Features</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Extension will not be ported to work in Microsoft Internet Explorer.<a href="https://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=2&amp;qpcustomd=0"> The percentage of IE users is less than 15%.</a> (NOTE:  https://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=2&amp;qpcustomd=0) It is very difficult and time consuming to port the extension to IE. Therefore the decision was made not to do this.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="non-functional-requirements">Non-functional Requirements</h2>

<h4 id="maintainability">Maintainability</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Code is of high quality: modularity, maintainability and brevity are of utmost importance in general.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use ECMAScript 6  to enable better management of modules, dependencies and classes in specific.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Code should be nicely documented, such that a new team can easily take over with this unknown codebase</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="usablility">Usablility</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The extension should not be invasive</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The user has the option to modify the extension up to such a level where the user is intercepted often enough to make it not bug the user, but still be helpful.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>This in general leads to the need for a highly customizable user experience in which he/she can pick every setting themselves</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The user has the option of putting the extension in Lazy mode or to turn off the extension for a certain amount of time.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>User can easily modify how the extension works.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>In the options page, the users can customize the blacklist, the time they have between intercepts, the turn off time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Users should not be intercepted when they want to use sites from the blacklist with a different goal than to browse them, specific example: the “Log in with Facebook” option that is provided by other applications/ sites.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="deployment-of-the-application">Deployment of the application</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The extension is ready for deployment under the Chrome Extensions store as a beta-run</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The users have the possibility of giving feedback</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A feedback form is available by following the link on the options page</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="weekly-progress">Weekly progress</h2>

<p>Here, the requirements of the customer are shown chronologically.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First meeting for SE2 - 24.04.2017:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Remove login</strong>: 
  From the tooltip menu, we had to remove the login button 
  We implemented this by moving the login functionality to the options page until the Zeeguu login functionality with cookies will be deployed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Time tracking per distraction/blocked site</strong>: 
  Before, the amount of interceptions for each blocked site was being tracked. However, tracking time wasted on each distraction is also being tracked now.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Disable blocking this page button</strong>: 
  in the tooltip, there is a ‘Save current page button’. When the user is on  a page that is already in the blacklist, the button will now be ‘Disable blocking this page’ and will disable the current page. The enabling back the page can be done from the same button. This functionality is equivalent of checking / unchecking the website from the list in the options page.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Change slider and input minutes</strong>: 
  in the options page, it is now possible to input a certain amount of time instead of just using the slider. Also, the color of the slider is changed.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second meeting for SE2 - 04.05.2017</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Polish application</strong>: 
  implement visual changes as provided in the feedback</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Remove login</strong>: 
  remove the login module of the Distraction Shield and use only the login provided by the Zeeguu application.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Add feedback form</strong>: 
  create a way in which the users can provide feedback to the extension</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Clean code and modularize application</strong>: 
  create a clean version of the extension using ECMA Script 6</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Third meeting for SE2 - 24.05.2017</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>ES6</strong>: 
  Finish our implementation of ECMA Script 6</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Login Injection</strong>: 
  Inject a personalized message into the Zeeguu login page so after first redirect to login, the user knows that it is us that took them there</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Tracking</strong>: 
  Implement first iteration of user tracking. Collect user data (Options changes, skips, time spent on exercises and blacklisted websites) so that it can be used for analysis</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Terms and Conditions</strong>: 
  Add terms and conditions for the user to accept upon installation</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourth online meeting for SE2 - 06.06.2017</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Set up a minimal website</strong>: using gh-pages for introduction purposes. This site can be used both for your final presentation as well as serve as an introduction for potential users.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Look into the <strong>prerequisites for publishing the extension</strong> on the Chrome store.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
